2022-12-04,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"I received a postcard from XXXX about a Home Equity Loan. While I was entering information a message came up they were running my credit. I never checked a box to authorize I wanted to complete the application nor have my credit run. I was not applying I was only trying to get information. I tried to stop by pushing the back button and then I got a message from XXXX XXXX stating a new credit inquiry was made on my credit. I never got any confirmation email from Discover and at first thought it was a fraudulent website. I am requesting the credit inquiry be removed from my credit. The Discover representative said all she could do was close out the application. I have been a Discover customer from many years and this totally destroyed any trust I had in this company.

2019-12-02,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,,"Hello, I had a second mortgage with Discover and sold the property. The second had a pre-payment penalty before making 12 payments starting XX/XX/XXXX. The property was sold in XX/XX/XXXX.

I recieved a mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX that clearly states no pre-payment penalty on the statement.

I was charged a {$480.00} pre-payment penalty. I called discover and they told me that if I was refinancing I would not have a penalty. But selling the property I do have penalty.??? My paperwork says no pre-payment penalty after 12 months of payments. Which I did make. This is rubbish trying to pass the buck based on tricky language. Either you have a pre-payment penalty or you do not. I did as my paperwork said, and reflected on my most recent statement. Please send payment to me accordingly.",,DISCOVER BANK,FL,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3455874,987654321
2019-12-12,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,,"I had a home equity loan with Discover Bank for {$75000.00}. In both the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, it states under "" Prepayment Penalty '' that there was none. I was also told this verbally. However, in a later set of documents it does describe a prepayment penalty if paid off within 36 months. I believe this discrepancy between the documents is deceptive. I believe I was lead to believe that there would not be a prepayment penalty and was surprised to find this {$420.00} penalty in my payoff letter. I spoke with a representative who agreed that it was misleading then a supervisor who noted that it was in another document which I signed. I told him I felt deceived but he was not willing to refund the prepayment penalty. I'm curious as to how many other people they are doing this to.",,DISCOVER BANK,IL,60302,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-12,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3466832,456789123

2023-09-04,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Application denials,I went to apply for XXXX home equity loan on XX/XX/XXXX. I got full pre-approval under the terms of 30 year loan interest of 9.99 %. I accepted this. They then requested lots of different information that I submitted. Every file said accepted. On XX/XX/XXXX I called them up because there was a small problem with the mortage statement I submitted. At this time I was told I was no longer approved because of debt to income ratio. The thing being I already had pre-approval and even the proof of income was already accepted. This loan would have been XXXX of my current debt payments without the loan.,,DISCOVER BANK,WY,82801,,Consent provided,Web,2023-09-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7494116,135724681
